I love watching soccer and wanted to visualize/analyze some data from some of my favorite players and matches.

The Wirtz ShotMap file utilizes data from the 2023/24 Bundesliga season to map Florian Wirtz's shots - which were goals, which were misses,
  and more, taking into account xG and other important variables. I want to see where Wirtz is more effective, as he a big target for FC Barcelona
  as a "marquee signing" in 2026 as presidential elections for the club are coming up. 

The Olmo vs Gundogan heatmap was inspired by Dani Olmo's recent FC Barcelona registration. Gundogan left the club to free up financial space
  so Barcelona had the financial room to register Olmo. The players play the same position (attacking midfield), but I wanted to see their heatmaps 
  in arguably one of the best games of UEFA Euro 2024 where they played against each other. I want to see what space they occupy and what FC Barcelona
  will be gaining and losing with this registration.
